# Forest Cover Prediction 

As part of my continuing education in data science, I worked on a Kaggle Competition dataset focussed on predicting the forest cover type from a number of variables in the Roosevelt National Forest in Colorado, USA. This dataset contained 12 predictor variables of pedologic, spatial and temporal concern. The work I did for this project involves data visualisation, variable selection using random forest importance measures, and machine learning using k-nearest neighbours and random forest methods. All work was done using R.
